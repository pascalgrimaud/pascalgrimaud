Hello, I'm Pascal.

üíª Java developer for around fifteen years, specializing in web application development, DevOps, and software architecture. I use my experience and expertise to support you in your projects, thus contributing to their success and their creation of value.

üõ†Ô∏è Passionate about technical excellence, I strive to promote the principles of Software Craftsmanship in every mission I undertake, as I am convinced that code quality is the cornerstone of the success of any project.

‚ù§Ô∏è Currently, I am one of the co-leaders of the Open Source [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/) project and the creator of [JHipster Lite](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-lite), a modular version of the project generator.
